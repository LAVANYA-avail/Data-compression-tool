#The C program uses a basic data compression and decompression tool that uses RLE algorithm. It reads a plain text from a input text file and compresses repeated characters and stores the file in binary file named compressed file which has reduced space than the orginal input file and the program also includes decompression feature that reads compressed file and reconstructs the orginal content writing space between them and stores it in another text file. It helped me to understand the fundamental file handling in C.
